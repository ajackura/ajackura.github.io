I am an Assistant Professor in the Nuclear theory group at William & Mary. My research interests are in hadron and nuclear reactions, hadron spectroscopy, few-body dynamics, and Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics.

<!-- I am a member of the [Hadron Spectrum collaboration](https://jeffersonlab.github.io/hadspec/), and an affiliated member of the [Joint Physics Analysis Center](http://cgl.soic.indiana.edu/jpac/index.php).  -->
