### Hadrons, Nuclei, & Quantum Chromodynamics

Most of the visible mass in the universe is due to nuclei and their interactions. However, our understanding of the emergent nuclear phenomena in terms of their constituent quarks and gluons through Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) has remained elusive. My research focuses on understanding QCD by studying few-body nuclear reactions, and developing non-perturbative methods to use in lattice QCD analyses. Particularly, I am interested in three-body scattering processes to understand the role of three-body nuclear forces. Additionally, I am investigating electroweak transitions of multi-hadron systems to gain insight on the structure of hadrons
