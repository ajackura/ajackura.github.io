Below I list some teaching and outreach experiences, along with links to lectures and exercise notebooks I have created.

### ODU University Physics I
In Fall 2022, I was offered the opportunity to lecture Physics 226N/231N/261N - University Physics I, the introductory physics course for scientists and engineers at Old Dominion University.

### RPI Computational Summer School 2022
I gave a set of lectures on introductory scattering theory and lattice QCD for hadron spectroscopy at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) computational summer school 2022. I prepared a set of exercises in Python using Jupyter notebooks which can be found
[here](https://github.com/ajackura/RPISummerSchoolHadspec).

### REYES Nuclear Physics Mentor Program

I co-hosted the **Nuclear Physics Mentor Program** through [Remote Experience for Young Engineers and Scientists (REYES)](https://www.odu.edu/reyes) in the summer/fall of 2021 and 2022.  Our goal was to introduce concepts of QCD, scattering theory, and nuclear spectroscopy to a broad audience. I wrote a set of lectures and Python notebooks on the basic mathematical and physical concepts needed to understand nuclear interactions. The video playlist for the 2021 lectures can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVs7RfracJBa1BpHAcw_MEoJP2zy57lNl), and the lecture slides and Python exercise notebooks are located [here](https://github.com/ajackura/NuclearPhysicsMentorProgram2021). The 2022 playlist is located [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVs7RfracJBZIfpGtLLZR1iCdqeRY2nzm).



### Lattice Practices 2021

In June 28 – July 16, 2021, I participated in the [INT Summer School on Problem Solving in Lattice QCD](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/lqcdschool2021), where I developed numerical exercises for the Hadron Spectroscopy lectures.  Raúl Briceño was the main lecturer, and his lecture videos are linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDi14w7i5C3Bm3U1IQ4n596UZQhOpr1Cx). The exercises are located [here](https://github.com/ajackura/LatticeSummerSchool2021-ScatteringExercises).

### Indiana University Summer School on Reaction Theory 2017

I taught lectures on Partial Wave Analysis and Resonances at the 2017 [Indiana University Summer School on Reaction Theory](http://cgl.soic.indiana.edu/jpac/schools.html). The school was organized by the [Joint Physics Analysis Center (JPAC)](http://cgl.soic.indiana.edu/jpac/index.php), with the purpose of education young researches on details of scattering theory for hadron spectroscopy. Video lectures and exercises can be found [here](http://cgl.soic.indiana.edu/jpac/schools.html).
